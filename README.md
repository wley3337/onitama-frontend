This is a project with August Giles with the original repo [here](https://github.com/AugustGiles/onitama-frontend)


TO DO:
* remove event listener from player 1's cards when player 2 is active
* add event listener to cards after player selects piece
    
* CSS fixes on smaller screens:
    * buttons for top card are hidden 'under' lower card
    * set min width for view port with overflow scroll bar
    * add shadding difference to cards until player is selected
    * Refactor fetch urls for easy switching between local and production
